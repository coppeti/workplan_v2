The application is used to manage the different activities of 
a group of technicians.

The application mainly presents a general view in the form of 
an annual calendar and all the activities of the technicians.

Each technician can enter his vacation periods.
He can also register if he is in training, sick, in the army, 
etc.


There are 2 main activities, the on-call and the dispatching.

The on-call service is covered from Monday for a period of 7 
days by each technician in turn.

The dispatching is covered during working days by each 
technician in turn for a period of one week.

These 2 activities are planned at the beginning of the year by 
the administrator.


During the year, each technician can exchange assignments with 
another technician.

Each change is logged and at the end of each day they are sent 
to the team by email for information.

There is a logbook where all the data is collected for 
statistical purposes.
